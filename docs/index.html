        <h1>Determining Optimum Music Recommendation Models using Clustering</h1>

            <h2>Overview:</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to identify the clustering algorithms that would best work with 
                musical data and could be used in a music recommendation application. We systematically tested various algorithms
                with different types of dimensional reduction methods against the FMA metadata set and evaluated their silhouette scores.

            <h2>Dataset and use of Dimensional Reduction:</h2>
            <p>
                We used the Free Music Archive metadata dataset as it is a highly featured dataset while also providing clean
                and easy to use data and utilities. Columns include audio features such as "acousticness," "danceability," and "energy." 
                Temporal Features were also included in the dataset, which are a collection of about 223 scalar values corresponding to 
                the evolution of the timbre throughout the track.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the high quantity of dimensions in this dataset, it is necessary to apply Dimensional Reduction techniques to
                bring the bring that number down to a more manageable quantity. In this project we used the PCA and UMAP dimensional Reduction
                techniques and observed their effect on various clustering algorithms.

            <h2>KMeans Clustering:</h2>
            <p>
                KMeans is a unsupervised clustering method that
                groups data points together by pairing each point with their
                "K'th" neighbor. This is determined generally through simple
                Euclidean distance calculations where each K-point is selected 
                due to their specific distance from other K-points. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project we calculated K-clusters using an elbow chart, 
                but we believe the results of this chart to be inaccurate due to
                the amount of inertia within our dataset. Ultimately we test K
                values for an optimum Silhouette score and landed at K = 20.
            </p>    
            <p>
                For each DR method used KMeans scored consistently higher than
                the alternative methods on the same data. Below is the
                scatter plots, elbow charts and Silhouette score graphs we used
                to formulate our results.

            <h2>KMeans++ Clustering:</h2>
            <p>
                KMeans++ is an evolution of the standard KMeans clustering method that 
                changes the way cluster centers are picked. Rather than centroids being picked at random,
                Kmeans++ picks centroids by selecting one random point, then through several distance
                calculations the next centroids are picked until the edges of the dataset are found. Once the
                edges of the data set are found, standard KMeans is ran using those centroids as cluster centers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar to our thought process with KMeans, we selected K = 20 as a better center for our data
                to compensate for the intertia within our dataset. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                Overall for each dimensional reduction test, KMeans++ kept up with its predecessor KMeans with a
                very small margin of error. In being so similar to KMeans, KMeans++ did also produce one of the
                higher silhouette scores out of all of the methods we tested. This is due to KMeans and KMeans++ 
                ability to traverse over high density data with a generally continuous topology.

            <h2>Birch Clustering:</h2>
            <p>
                Birch is a clustering algorithm that works by using data summaries
                comprised of cluster features. These cluster features contain metrics like number of points,
                euclidean distance values and squared distance values. IF a point being read does not fit
                within a cluster's summary it is passed to another cluster to be checked. Once checked if it
                is determined that a point belongs to no current cluster, a new summary is created using that
                point as a base. This process is then repeated until every data point has been checked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Birch clustering did not result in very strong silhouette scores throughout each of the three
                tests we did using different dimensional reduction tools. This is due to the high density of
                points within the given data. Birch's approach of using data summaries can be good for low density
                data points, but in the context of the FMA dataset, the clusters were not able to become clearly
                defined from each other with this method.

            <h2>GMM Clustering:</h2>
            <p>
                GMM is a clustering method that uses a Gaussian mixture model to determine clusters
                within the dataset. To do this GMM uses expectation maximization to determine which data points
                are determined to be true clusters, which entails weighting the probabilities of a point
                belonging to a certain cluster through a series of metrics. These metrics can include euclidean distance,
                numerical value, and point averages.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our tests GMM scored fairly standard in its silhouette score. In fact, in the context of our results,
                the scores produced by GMM were often the median result of the methods we tested. This is likely a consequence
                of the data point density present within the FMA dataset. If all points are compacted towards each other, it is
                through a much similar margin that clusters are determined and points are assigned as the weights dictating which
                points belong to which clusters are going to me very similar.

            <h2>Agglomerative Clustering:</h2>
            <p>
                Agglomerative clustering is a bottom-up approach to clustering,
                focusing on creating a hierarchy through a defined linkage type. For this
                project we opted for the standard "ward" linkage type as it was the default 
                choice and was optimal for limiting variance between data points. Once each cluster
                is defined, a hierarchy is then made which can be seen in our dendrogram below.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Agglomerative clustering produced sub-standard results for our testing, While in general, 
                the score produced by the agglomerative tests were standard we believe the low S-score is 
                a consequence of the effect of high dimensionality of the dataset we were working with. 
                The higher the dimensionality of the data, the more the distances begin to "compress" in 
                the sense that distances become nearly equal. Seeing as Agglomerative clustering relies 
                heavily on pairwise distances, this effect causes points to be clustered arbitrarily.

                We see the noticeable effect of high dimensional data on algorithms that depend heavily on pairwise distance metrics.
                Starting with the scatter plot on the left we can see the instability of the clusters by how "fuzzy" they look 
                rather than having distinct borders. The S-scores chart also corroborates this difficulty as the average score was a
                mere <b>.001</b>. The dendrogram reflects these uniform distances as the merges happened almost always on very similar looking
                (height wise) clusters.

                The impact of UMAP is seen yet again in the scatter plot. There are now significantly more distinct cluster regions in 
                the data. Similarly the Silhouette Graph looks significantly cleaner, having a more concrete score of <b>.204</b> and indicating that
                more points are actually within clusters they belong to. The dendrogram on the right also demonstrates the much cleaner
                and less noisy that the UMAP clustering provided. Here the clusters happen at lower heights indicating more stability.

                Scatter plot results for the hybrid approach were actually very similar, almost identical, to that of the UMAP approach.
                Clusters were, again, clearly visible and much less noisy than the PCA approach. The silhouette graph shows the exact same 
                score as the UMAP approach: <b>.204</b>. The dendrogram again shows stability as well.

            <h2>DBSCAN clustering:</h2>
            <p>
                DBSCAN is an unsupervised clustering method that works by determining which points are
                core points by checking if there are a minimum number of points detected within a given radius
                of the center. This process is then repeated recursively until all points have been considered as
                potential centers for a respective cluster. Clusters are only considered to be clusters if 
                that minimum threshold is met.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is here that we begin to observe the significant impacts of dimensional reduction and feature space
                topology, particularly for density-based algorithms. We noticed distinct differences between DBSCAN
                and the alternative clustering algorithms. DBSCAN produced only one cluster in the PCA run of the dataset 
                and therefore produced no Silhouette score for that run. We believe this is a result of the data's smooth
                and highly continuous density topology. Algorithms like these depend heavily on having distinct density regions
                separated by clear areas of low density, so when working with the opposite type of topology it is very easy 
                for these algorithms to identify only 1 or 2 big cluster in the data.
            </p>    
            <p>
                DBSCAN was an outlier within our results, producing in irregular data
                that does not fit the general trend created by other clustering methods
                discussed above. For the PCA dimensional reduction no S-Score was produced,
                then for the UMAP and Hybrid dimensional reductions, a very large score was produced.

                Scatter plot results for the PCA approach show how much DBSCAN struggled with the topology of our data;
                identifying only one major cluster in all of the data. Due to this there is no corresponding S-score graph,
                but the k-distance plot on the right also highlights just how much the high dimensionality of the data, combined
                with the challenging topology and PCA dimensional reduction technique affects the algorithm. We can see that the 
                distance between neighbors only increases when it is almost at the end of the dataset, consistent with a single large
                cluster.

                UMAP again helped DBSCAN slightly, but not enough to reveal all clusters. As can be seen in the scatter plot, there are 
                now two highlighted clusters. Interestingly, due to the difference in size and density of these two identified clusters
                the S-Score was significantly skewed towards 1. This can be seen in the Silhouette graph; the bigger cluster is dragging
                the S-Score higher than it actually should, clocking in at: <b>.358</b>. This score, along with the distance plot on the right, might be misleading
                at first glance, as it might show inaccurately good-looking scores for an algorithm that actually performed sub-par.

            <h2>HDBSCAN Clustering:</h2>
            <p>
                HDBSCAN is a clustering method that works by searching for different densities of
                data points on a graph. Once the densities have been determined clusters are defined by
                the clear shift in densities between "chunks" of data points on a graph. These clusters are then
                put into a hierarchical structure of a minimum spanning tree. An important requirement for HBDSCAN
                is that there must be a clear difference in point densities for a cluster to be identified, otherwise
                it is likely that the data will not be processed properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project we determined HDBSCAN to as similarly disadvantaged as DBSCAN, and therefore is considered
                an outlier method within our results. HDBSCAN's dependency on well defined density regions causes it to struggle
                in a similar way to DBSCAN in the sense that it identifies only 1 or 2 large clusters. We attribute this to the 
                continuous topology of our FMA dataset. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                HDBSCAN produced drastically high S-Score values, but only identified very few clusters.
                This means that for the results of this method must be considered as outliers and abnormal.
                The performance of HDBSCAN also serves as a piece of evidence that the topology of the data we are working with is 
                indeed a highly continuous manifold rather than distinct clusters. It also shows that hierarchical algorithms are not
                well suited for categorizing music data as there are few trends that would result in a clearly
                defined hierarchy that HDBSCAN would require for creating defined clusters.

                more accurate than those produced by DBSCAN while using PCA, but still does not accurately represent our data. As 
                can be seen in the Silhouette Score graph, these two clusters generated an S-Score of <b>.03</b>. The Condensed cluster 
                tree accurately reflects how one cluster dominates and how these two clusters quickly become unstable as we go up in density.

                We determined that KMeans and KMeans++ are the most optimum clustering
                methods to use when working with music data under dimensional reduction. This is due to KMeans/KMeans++ ability to handle high
                point densities without sacrificing its accuracy. In this context outlier data is not very significant
                so the standard drawback of noise impacting the methods is not as impactful. While Agglomerative and GMM
                produced fairly standard results they both suffered drawbacks as a consequence of the dataset's structure.
                Additionally clustering methods like DBSCAN and HDBSCAN proved non-functional in high density clusters due
                to the continuous topology of the dataset and the dimensional reduction undertaken during the tests.

                The figure above showcases the results of the various algorithms tested in this project, with 
                green highlighting the highest scores and dark red highlighting the lowest. Highlighted in bright
                red are also the results of the density-based algorithms which, as mentioned above, displayed misleadingly
                high S-Scores. 

                It is interesting to note how these scores are not the final verdict when it comes to algorithm accuracy, and it goes to show
                that it is important to verify the validity of our results.

                To conclude, it is important to note the challenging nature of musical feature space. We are working with a feature space
                topology that is notoriously difficult to cluster due to the uniform distribution of point density, the effects of high 
                dimensionality, and the fact that this feature space is a highly continous manifold rather than easily identifiable and clearly
                distinct clusters or globular structures. Our results highlight these facts and provide evidence for the aforementioned nature of 
                data like this.
