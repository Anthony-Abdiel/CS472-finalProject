            <h2>Overview:</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to identify the clustering algorithms that would best work with 
                musical data and could be used in a music recommendation application. We systematically tested various algorithms
                with different types of dimensional reducuction methods against the FMA metadata set and evaluated their silhouette scores.

            <h2>Dataset and use of Dimensional Reduction:</h2>
            <p>
                We used the Free Music Archive metadata dataset as it is a highly featured dataset while also providing clean
                and easy to use data and utilities. Columns include audio features such as "acousticness," "danceability," and "energy." 
                Temporal Features were also included in the dataset, which are a collection of about 223 scalar values corresponding to 
                the evolution of the timbre throughout the track.

                Due to the high quantitiy of dimensions in this dataset, it is necessary to apply Dimensional Reduction techniques to
                bring the bring that number down to a more manageable quantity. In this project we used the PCA and UMAP dimensional Reduction
                techniques and observed their effect on various clustering algorithms.
